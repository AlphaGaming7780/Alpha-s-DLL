# Alpha’s DLL – Civilization V Mod (Archived)

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
This repository is **archived**. The project has not been updated in many years, and I cannot guarantee that the DLL included here is the latest version. It’s a build I recovered from an old USB drive, so treat it as a historical snapshot rather than an authoritative release.
